# ESMR
Heterogeneous Academic Network Embedding Based Multivariate Random-Walk Model for

Predicting Scientifific Impact

## Introduce

In this paper, we propose a novel model called ESMR, which adds the learned Embeddings and global Structure information to Multivariate Random-walk, to predict the future scientific influence of papers and authors.

## Step 1ï¼šPrepare   dataset
---
We use the dataset from https://www.aminer.cn/citation. the version is [DBLP-Citation-network V12](https://originalstatic.aminer.cn/misc/dblp.v12.7z)

Enviorment Requirement for processdata :

install nltk,pyyaml,numpy,tqdm,gensim(the latest version)

prepare

> import nltk
>
> nltk.download()

At this time, a graphical interface will pop up, and several pieces of data will be displayed for you to download. It is best to choose to download. This process will take a while. After the corpus is downloaded, NLTK is really available on your computer.

## Step 2: processdata 

**Raw data processing**

Remove the citation relationship of papers published after 2015 (the number of citations in the future will only consider the articles to be ranked, that is, those published before 2015)

Remove the cited information after 2015

Remove papers that have no references or are not cited by other articles (covered)

Remove papers without a title or abstract

 ```python
 processdata.py
 ```
You can get the weight between author and author,between paper and paper,and between author and paper.

**Document processing**

```
get_wordtopic.py
```

You can get the weight between paper and word,between paper and topic, and between word and topic

**Classify processing**

```
pclassci.py
author_classic.py
find_FirstPub.py
```

If you want make experiments in deffient ways,you can reference it.

## Step 3: train and test

**(1) get all network embbeding**

```
PaperAuthorEmbedding.java
```

You can directly set the embedded dimension

**(2)calculate similarity**

```
Similarity.java
```

**(3)get rank results**

```
CoRank.java
```

**(4)test and evaluation by RI and NDCG**

```
MetricRI.java
MetricNDCG.java
```
